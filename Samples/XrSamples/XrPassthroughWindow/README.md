# OpenXR Passthrough Window Sample

This sample demonstrates how to show passthrough as the background and render a simple floating window that can be resized and faded using the controller joysticks. The window itself is currently empty but can be populated with content later.

The Gradle wrapper JAR is intentionally omitted from version control. Running
`./gradlew` in the Android project directory will download the required wrapper files automatically.
