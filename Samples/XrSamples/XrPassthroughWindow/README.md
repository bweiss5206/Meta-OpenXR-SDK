# OpenXR Passthrough Window Sample

This sample demonstrates how to display passthrough as the background. It renders the controllers, but no additional UI window is shown.
The sample requires a headset with the `XR_FB_passthrough` extension (Quest runtime v53 or newer).

The Gradle wrapper JAR is intentionally omitted from version control. Running
`./gradlew` in the Android project directory will download the required wrapper files automatically.
